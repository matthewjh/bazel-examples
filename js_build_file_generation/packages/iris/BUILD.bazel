# 💁 A npm "package" target. This target creates a directory that is linkable with pnpm workspaces
#
# 🏃 COMING SOON: In the future, this will also create a runnable `.publish` target to publish the
# package to an npm registry.
#
# 💡 DESIGN: We won't need an npm_package for every "importer" in the pnpm workspace. The BUILD file
# generator will need to check the lock file to see which importers are also depended on as "links"
# by other importers/packages.
